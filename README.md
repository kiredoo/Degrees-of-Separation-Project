# Degrees of Separation Project
This is the repository of the submission files to [CS50'S Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/)'s [assignment](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/projects/0/degrees/#background) 

## Repository Layout
- `degrees.py` - contains the main code and algorithm for finding the shortest path between two actors
- `utils.py` - contains the classes and functions for the algorithm
- `large` and `small` directories - contains the data files storing actor ids, movies, and stars, which relates the actors with the movies they starred in

## Running the Script
Simply load the workspace and run `degrees.py` by entering `python3 degrees.py large` or `python3 degrees.py small` in the terminal.
